canvas scale by css transform
<br/>
We usually use resize to scale the canvas
<br/>
it needs to clear the canvas, calculate the scale,
<br/>
save the martrix, and recalculate the contents of the canvas
<br/>

It is recommended to use css transform to zoom the canvas,
<br/>
to ensure that the parent's element zoom will not affect other
<br/>
elements to zoom the parent label
